# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker solution
## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load. To know your ip adress, go to chrome or firefox or any    browser and search for "myipaddress"
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Useful resources

- [Leaflet resource](https://leafletjs.com/examples/mobile/) - This helped me to build may for different locations. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Geolocation API resource](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - This resource also assisted me on fetching map information using geo.ipify. I'd recommend other developers to utilize this tool because it is simple to use even the documentation explains itself.
